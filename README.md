Spotifly is a Spotify companion App that was designed to give users the freedom to generate playlist recommendations on demand. Gone are the days to wait for Spotify to auto generate playlists for you! Spotifly uses the Spotify Web API service to authorize and retrieve user data. The data is then sorted and used in combination with preset themes/genres provided by Spotifly to create playlist recommendations based on user listening habits. The playlists created through Spotifly are automatically uploaded to the user's Spotify Library and are fully customizable! Spotifly hopes to give users a quick way to discover new music. 

How quick is Spotifly?
* Sign in and authorize your Spotify Account 
* Select a playlist option and input a playlist name
* Create the playlist
* Listen in no time!

Spotifly does not guarantee to be fully accurate with playlist recommendations but that is the beauty of finding new tracks. If you don't like what you see, generate a new playlist! No two playlists generated by Spotifly will ever be the same.
